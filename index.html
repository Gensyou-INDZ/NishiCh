                    Dying is sad and Nishi is not going to do "Dying" Stream for this year.<br>
                    But in fact, it may be replaced by something else, maybe a unique stream,<br>
                    or just a day for him to take a break before his birthday.<br>
                    Thus, the "Dying" Stream at 5 of June will be changed and replaced by another fun content,<br>
                    or cancel to be a holiday for this cute boy.
