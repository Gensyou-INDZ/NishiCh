                <h1>The History Model of Nishi</h1>
                <img src="Photo_and_Pictures/IMG_20210204_205818 (1).png" alt="First Ever Model" style="width: 15%; margin-left: 4%;">
                <p>
                    The first model of Nishi the Wolf is from the application <a href="https://reality.app/login">Reality Avater</a>, it's a 3D model. <br>
                    The eyes of his model in this period is blue and green, different than the one he's using now.<br>
                    And since Reality doesn't support tail, his first model doesn't include tails.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="Photo_and_Pictures/Background.png" alt="Second Model" style="width: 15%; margin-left: 4%;">
                <p>
                    The second model of Nishi is from Vroid, it's another 3D model.<br>
                    it's a bit ugly since the application is more for professional modelling at that time.<br>
                    Since Vroid has hair modelling, the hair can use to replace his tail.<br>
                    So in this model onwards, there are tails behind him.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="Photo_and_Pictures/NishiLeanOnTable.png" alt="Third Model" style="width: 15%; margin-left: 4%;">
                <p>
                    The third model is same from Vroid, but this time, <br>
                    Vroid is more developed than before and it's more user friendly. <br>
                    But it's still doesn't support tail modeling at that time like today. <br>
                    So the tail is still replaced by hair.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="Photo_and_Pictures/NishiWTF.gif" alt="Forth and Latest model" style="width: 15%; margin-left: 4%;">
                <p>
                    The forth model, the latest one. It's not Vroid or 3D model anymore.<br>
                    It's a proper Live2D design by <a href="https://twitter.com/shinazu_kazuma">Kazuma</a><br>
                    and it's draw by a Malaysian V-Artist name <a href="https://twitter.com/KoShiNa_VT">Koshina</a> and<br>
                    it's rigged by Malaysian VTuber Model Rigger <a href="https://twitter.com/KnightsOtis">Knights_Otis</a>.<br>
                    For this Live2D, it's design with Japanese Clothing style,<br>
                    It has many meaningful design on the outfit, especially those Flowers on it.
